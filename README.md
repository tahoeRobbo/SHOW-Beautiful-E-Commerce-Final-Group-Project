We (Robert Hallowell, Andy Johnson, Alicia Chen, Peter Greismer, Tyler Tebbs and input from Page Garner) created a beautiful, responsive, feature rich mock e-commerce site using the MEAN stack integrated with PayPal payment systems, amazon S3, and SendGrid.  The public views allow customers to sort products by categories, add items to a custom built cart and request items that are temporarily unavailable.  The admin side, built off a login secured API, allows the site owner to upload new products, manage existing ones, and contact customers who are wait listed for products.   Upon checkout, customers receive a confirmation 'thank you' email and the purchased products are automatically deducted from the inventory.

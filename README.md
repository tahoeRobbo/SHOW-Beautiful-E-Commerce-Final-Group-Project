Goldmorning Shop is a fully-functioning e-commerce site set up by five students from DevMountain's Web Development Immersive program. With contributions from Robert Hallowell, Andy Johnson, Alicia Chen, Peter Griesmer, and Tyler Tebbs (with direction from mentor Page Garner), the project was commissioned by Beulah Ekkelenkamp and will ultimately operate alongside her style blog by the same name.
